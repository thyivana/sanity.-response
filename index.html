				<h3>Sanity: Uncool, but surprisingly livable</h3> 
				<p>If you're not into chaos and spontaneous emotional combustion, sanity might actually be the underrated life choice. Sure, it's not as glamorous as spiraling into existential confusion or chasing delusions of grandeur, but being mentally stable does have its perks—like remembering where you put your keys or not texting your ex. Society might glorify madness as "genius" or "authentic," but let's be honest: sometimes it's nice to just function. Our advice: try a calm weekend with zero breakdowns—you might just like it.</p>
